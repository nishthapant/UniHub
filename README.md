# PROJECT - findIt

## The Idea:

This is an in progress web applcation which is intended to help aspiring university students to decide which univeristy offers the best courses in their area of interest. The seed of the idea was sown during a discussion about how we, as international aspiring students, had to put put in a lot of hours in comparing univeristies and deciding which one will be the best one for us based on our areas of interest.

- This web applciation aims to help aspiring university students to view courses offered in different areas of study by Canada's 5 most prestigious universities in the same window.

- For a selected subject or area of interest, they can view course inromation for all the courses offered by the University of Alberta, the University of Toronto, the University of British Columbia, the University of Waterloo and McGill University in one window.
